///////

- Please make sure you have the latest Python version installed and that you insall any requirements (ie json, csv, random, string, colorama).

  // HOW TO USE //
  
- Create a folder place your Cybersole 5.x JSON file inside along with the cyber-csv python script.

- Open a CMD/powershell window inside said folder and type py cybercsv.py

- Select your option to convert JSON to CSV or CSV to JSON
  NOTE ONLY CYBERSOLE JSONS WILL WORK AND ONLY CSVS CONVERTED BY THE SCRIPT WILL WORK!

- Type the name of your file including format (ie test.json) and then type in the name of the outputted file (ie test.csv)

  The script will then import and convert your Cybersole JSON into a CSV where you can manually edit via RONSEDITOR for convenience. When you are done you can then repeat the steps inside the script to convert your modified CSV to a functional Cybersole JSON.
